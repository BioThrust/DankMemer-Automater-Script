# DankMemer-Automater-Script
A Script that automates the DankMemer game.

How to start it.

Open discord and stay on it.
Run the executable
Click on the discord text box
The executable should run in 10-20 seconds.


Get Around Windows Defender.
Because I am not a professional developer, My program is not licensed by a company. Sometimes Windows Defender may block the program due to this. If you get this error, click on more info and run anyway.

Hopefully this works....

V2: Major update

This version of the bot uses selenium to automate this process. This means that running this program will not affect what you are doing. you could be watching youtube or playing Minecraft and this program would still work in the background. To set it up, put your discord email in the email.txt file. Put your discord password in the password.txt file. Don't worry I'm not that good of a programmer that i can reroute the code and send it to me, so don't worry about security. Put your server channel link in destination.txt to have the program go to that server after logging in. Be warned of the consequences, as this MAY lead to a ban on Discord entirely, as well as a ban on Dankmemer if caught. I have tried my best to randomize the timing to emulate a human and so far I have not been banned. However this is a beta project and i am not entirely sure.
